# PyBer_Analysis

  ## Goal
We were presented with two data files, which contained information for ride sharing company with info such as ( driver count, dates, fares, cities by city types ( urban, suburban and rural) etc. Our goal was to clean, sort and organize data in order to see which city type performed better, based on total rides count and total revenues.

   ### Findings
After performing analysis it was clear that urban areas thrived, even though their Average fare per ride were cheaper, total volume brought more revenues. It also became operant that rural areas brought less revenues . Overal it was less rides and less drivers available.

  ## Conclusion
Rideshare companies always perform better in urban areas, where having car is more expensive to keep and to park, so ppl opt for rental/rideshare/Uber type business.
The reasons for rural areas to have less popularity for such services are:
  *Poor internet reception ( which all those buseinesses heavely rely on),
  *Dropping pins and finding locations are harder because of lack of map development for rural areas,
  *Statistically, not everyone in rural areas have credit|debit cards to use. ( as per company polices you usually have to have your card attached to account before you    order a car),
  *Lack of drivers.
  
  ## Recomendations for CEO
*Create a call center to eliminate problems with Wi-Fi,
*Suggest drivers to park near central, busy areas like malls, theaters, stadiums, etc to easily access crowds,
*Improve payment system, accept cash or other alternative forms of payment,
*Raise salary for drivers, as those rides already bring more revenue, make it more interesting for drivers.
